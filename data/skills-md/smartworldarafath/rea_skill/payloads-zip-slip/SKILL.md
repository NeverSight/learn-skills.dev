> **Category:** `payloads-research` | **Skill ID:** `payloads-zip-slip`

## Overview

Zip slip archive traversal payloads for arbitrary file write via malicious ZIP/TAR archives.

This skill integrates the full **PayloadsAllTheThings** (PATT) payload library for the **Zip Slip Payloads** domain into the REA_Skill framework. Use it during authorized penetration testing, bug bounty research, security audits, and CTF challenges.

## Workflow

### 1. Recon & Identification
- Identify the target technology stack and injection points
- Enumerate endpoints, parameters, and input vectors
- Determine applicable payload categories from the reference below

### 2. Payload Selection
- Browse the PATT payload library for the attack class
- Select encoding-appropriate payloads for the target environment
- Consider WAF bypass variants and obfuscation techniques

### 3. Exploitation (Authorized Only)
- Test payloads in order: passive → active → escalation
- Document every payload tested and its response
- Capture PoC evidence (screenshots, HTTP logs, curl output)

### 4. Verification & Reporting
- Confirm the vulnerability with a clean minimal PoC
- Map findings to CVE/CWE where applicable
- Report with remediation recommendations and code fixes

# Zip Slip

> The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../shell.php). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine.

## Tools

* [ptoomey3/evilarc](https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc) - Create tar/zip archives that can exploit directory traversal vulnerabilities
* [usdAG/slipit](https://github.com/usdAG/slipit) - Utility for creating ZipSlip archives

## Methodology

The Zip Slip vulnerability is a critical security flaw that affects the handling of archive files, such as ZIP, TAR, or other compressed file formats. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files outside of the intended extraction directory, potentially overwriting critical system files, executing malicious code, or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Example**: Suppose an attacker creates a ZIP file with the following structure:

```ps1
malicious.zip
  ├── ../../../../etc/passwd
  ├── ../../../../usr/local/bin/malicious_script.sh
```

When a vulnerable application extracts `malicious.zip`, the files are written to `/etc/passwd` and /`usr/local/bin/malicious_script.sh` instead of being contained within the extraction directory. This can have severe consequences, such as corrupting system files or executing malicious scripts.

* Using [ptoomey3/evilarc](https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc):

    ```python
    python evilarc.py shell.php -o unix -f shell.zip -p var/www/html/ -d 15
    ```

* Creating a ZIP archive containing a symbolic link:

    ```ps1
    ln -s ../../../index.php symindex.txt
    zip --symlinks test.zip symindex.txt
    ```

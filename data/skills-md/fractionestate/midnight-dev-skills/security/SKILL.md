# Security Auditing for Midnight Network

Expert knowledge for auditing Midnight Network contracts and privacy-preserving applications.

## Security Priorities

1. **Privacy Protection** - Ensure sensitive data stays private
2. **Cryptographic Integrity** - Verify commitments, nullifiers, proofs
3. **Access Control** - Validate authorization patterns
4. **Input Validation** - Check all assertions and bounds
5. **State Safety** - Prevent manipulation and reentrancy

## Severity Classification

| Level    | Icon | Description                     | Examples                   |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Critical | 🔴   | Funds at risk, privacy broken   | Witness exposure, key leak |
| High     | 🟠   | Significant leak or bypass      | Predictable nullifier      |
| Medium   | 🟡   | Logic errors, incomplete checks | Missing validation         |
| Low      | 🟢   | Best practice violations        | Poor error messages        |
| Info     | ℹ️   | Improvement suggestions         | Code clarity               |

## Quick Checklist

### Compact Contracts

- [ ] All assertions have descriptive messages
- [ ] Sensitive data uses `witness` or `secret`
- [ ] No plaintext secrets in ledger
- [ ] Commitments use salt (hash2)
- [ ] Nullifiers include secret context
- [ ] Range checks before arithmetic
- [ ] Access control where needed

### TypeScript dApps

- [ ] Wallet availability checked
- [ ] Transactions properly confirmed
- [ ] No secrets logged or exposed
- [ ] Private state encrypted
- [ ] Error boundaries in place
- [ ] HTTPS enforced

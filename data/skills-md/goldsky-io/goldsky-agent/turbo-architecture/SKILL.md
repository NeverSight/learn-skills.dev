# Turbo Pipeline Architecture

Help users make architecture decisions for Turbo pipelines — source types, data flow patterns, resource sizing, sink strategies, streaming vs job mode, dynamic table design, and multi-chain deployment.

## Agent Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements

Ask the user about:

1. **What data?** — Which chain(s), which events/datasets, historical or real-time only?
2. **Where does it go?** — Database, webhook, streaming topic, multiple destinations?
3. **How much volume?** — Single contract or all chain activity? How many events/sec?
4. **Latency needs?** — Real-time dashboards (sub-second) or analytics (minutes OK)?

### Step 2: Recommend an Architecture

Use the patterns and decision guides below to recommend a pipeline architecture. Reference the templates in `templates/` as starting points:

- `templates/linear-pipeline.yaml` — Simple decode → filter → sink
- `templates/fan-out-pipeline.yaml` — One source → multiple sinks
- `templates/fan-in-pipeline.yaml` — Multiple events → UNION ALL → sink
- `templates/multi-chain-templated.yaml` — Per-chain pipeline pattern

### Step 3: Hand Off to Implementation Skills

After the architecture is decided, direct the user to:
- **`/turbo-pipelines`** — To build and deploy the YAML
- **`/turbo-transforms`** — To write the SQL transforms
- **`/secrets`** — To set up sink credentials

**Reminder:** When presenting complete pipeline YAML as part of architecture recommendations, validate it first with `goldsky turbo validate`. Templates in `templates/` are structural patterns — any customized version must be validated before presenting to the user.

## Source Types

### Dataset Sources — Historical + Real-Time

Use `type: dataset` when you need to process historical blockchain data and/or continue streaming new data.

```yaml
sources:
  my_source:
    type: dataset
    dataset_name: base.erc20_transfers
    version: 1.2.0
    start_at: earliest  # or: latest
```

**Best for:** Raw logs, transactions, transfers, blocks — anything where you need historical backfill or decoded event processing.

**Available EVM datasets:** `raw_logs`, `blocks`, `raw_transactions`, `raw_traces`, `erc20_transfers`, `erc721_transfers`, `erc1155_transfers`, `decoded_logs`

**Non-EVM chains also supported:** Solana (`solana.*`), Bitcoin (`bitcoin.raw.*`), Stellar (`stellar_mainnet.*`)

### Kafka Sources — Real-Time Streaming

> **Note:** Kafka sources are used in production pipelines but are **not documented** in the official Goldsky docs. Use with caution and contact Goldsky support for topic names.

Use `type: kafka` when consuming from a Goldsky-managed Kafka topic, typically for continuously-updated state like balances.

```yaml
sources:
  my_source:
    type: kafka
    topic: base.raw.latest_balances_v2
```

**Best for:** Balance snapshots, latest state data, high-volume continuous streams.

**Key differences from dataset sources:**
- No `start_at` or `version` fields
- Optional fields: `filter`, `include_metadata`, `starting_offsets`
- Delivers the latest state rather than historical event logs

### When to Use Which

| Scenario                          | Source Type | Why                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Decode contract events from logs  | `dataset`   | Need `raw_logs` + `_gs_log_decode()`         |
| Track token transfers             | `dataset`   | `erc20_transfers` has structured data        |
| Historical backfill + live        | `dataset`   | `start_at: earliest` processes history       |
| Live token balances               | `kafka`     | `latest_balances_v2` is a streaming topic    |
| Real-time state snapshots         | `kafka`     | Kafka delivers latest state continuously     |
| Only need new data going forward  | Either      | Dataset with `start_at: latest` or Kafka     |

---

## Data Flow Patterns

### Linear Pipeline

The simplest pattern. One source → one or more chained transforms → one sink.

```
source → transform_a → transform_b → sink
```

**Use when:** You have a single data source, single destination, and straightforward processing (decode, filter, reshape).

**Example:** `templates/linear-pipeline.yaml` — raw logs → decode → extract trade events → postgres

**Resource size:** `s` or `m`

### Fan-Out (One Source → Multiple Sinks)

One source feeds multiple transforms, each writing to a different sink.

```
              ┌→ transform_a → sink_1 (clickhouse)
source ──────┤
              └→ transform_b → sink_2 (webhook)
```

**Use when:** You need different views or subsets of the same data going to different destinations — e.g., balances to a warehouse AND token metadata to a webhook.

**Example:** `templates/fan-out-pipeline.yaml` — one Kafka source → fungible balances to ClickHouse + all tokens to a webhook

```yaml
transforms:
  fungible_balances:
    type: sql
    primary_key: id
    sql: |
      SELECT ... FROM latest_balances balance
      WHERE balance.token_type = 'ERC_20' OR balance.token_type IS NULL

  all_tokens:
    type: sql
    primary_key: id
    sql: |
      SELECT ... FROM latest_balances balance
      WHERE balance.token_type IN ('ERC_20', 'ERC_721', 'ERC_1155')

sinks:
  warehouse:
    type: clickhouse
    from: fungible_balances
    # ...
  webhook:
    type: webhook
    from: all_tokens
    # ...
```

**Resource size:** `m` (multiple output paths)

### Fan-In (Multiple Events → One Output)

Multiple event types decoded from the same source, normalized to a common schema, then combined with UNION ALL into a single sink.

```
              ┌→ event_type_a ──┐
source → decode ┤                 ├→ UNION ALL → sink
              └→ event_type_b ──┘
```

**Use when:** You want a unified activity feed, combining trades, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, etc. into one table.

**Example:** `templates/fan-in-pipeline.yaml` — one raw_logs source → decode → multiple event-type transforms → UNION ALL → ClickHouse

**Resource size:** `l` (complex processing with many transforms)

### Multi-Chain Fan-In

Multiple sources from different chains combined into a single output.

```
source_chain_a ──┐
source_chain_b ──┼→ UNION ALL → sink
source_chain_c ──┘
```

**Use when:** You want cross-chain analytics or a unified view across chains.

```yaml
sources:
  eth_transfers:
    type: dataset
    dataset_name: ethereum.erc20_transfers
    version: 1.0.0
    start_at: latest
  base_transfers:
    type: dataset
    dataset_name: base.erc20_transfers
    version: 1.2.0
    start_at: latest

transforms:
  combined:
    type: sql
    primary_key: id
    sql: |
      SELECT *, 'ethereum' AS chain FROM eth_transfers
      UNION ALL
      SELECT *, 'base' AS chain FROM base_transfers
```

**Resource size:** `m` or `l` depending on chain count

---

## Templated Multi-Chain Deployment

When you need the **same pipeline logic** across multiple chains, create separate pipeline files per chain rather than one multi-source pipeline. This gives you:

- Independent lifecycle (deploy/delete per chain)
- Independent checkpointing (one chain failing doesn't block others)
- Clearer monitoring per chain

**Pattern:** Copy the pipeline YAML and swap the chain-specific values:

| Field              | Chain A (base)                    | Chain B (arbitrum)                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | `base-balance-streaming`          | `arbitrum-balance-streaming`          |
| `topic`            | `base.raw.latest_balances_v2`     | `arbitrum.raw.latest_balances_v2`     |
| Source key         | `base_latest_balances_v2`         | `arbitrum_latest_balances_v2`         |
| Transform SQL      | `'base' AS chain`                 | `'arbitrum' AS chain`                 |
| Sink table         | `base_token_balances`             | `arbitrum_token_balances`             |

**Example:** `templates/multi-chain-templated.yaml` — shows the base chain version; duplicate for each chain.

**When to use templated vs multi-source:**

| Approach                | Pros                                          | Cons                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Templated (per-chain)   | Independent lifecycle, clear monitoring        | More files to manage                |
| Multi-source (one file) | Single deployment, cross-chain UNION possible  | Coupled lifecycle, harder to debug  |

## Resource Sizing

Each size doubles the previous tier's CPU and memory:

| Size  | Workers | CPU Request | Memory | When to Use                                                    |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `xs`  | —       | 0.4         | 0.5 Gi | Small datasets, light testing                                  |
| `s`   | 1       | 0.8         | 1.0 Gi | Testing, simple filters, single source/sink, low volume (default) |
| `m`   | 4       | 1.6         | 2.0 Gi | Multiple sinks, Kafka streaming, moderate transform complexity  |
| `l`   | 10      | 3.2         | 4.0 Gi | Multi-event decoding with UNION ALL, high-volume historical backfill |
| `xl`  | 20      | 6.4         | 8.0 Gi | Large chain backfills, complex JOINs (e.g. Solana accounts+transactions) |
| `xxl` | 40      | 12.8        | 16.0 Gi | Highest throughput needs; up to 6.3M rows/min                 |

**Rules of thumb from production pipelines:**

- Simple filter + single sink → `s` (default, try this first)
- Kafka source + multiple sinks OR multiple transforms → `m`
- Raw log decoding + 5+ event types + UNION ALL → `l`
- Historical backfill of high-volume data → `l` or `xl` (can downsize after catch-up)
- Start small and scale up — defensive sizing avoids wasted resources

## Sink Selection

### Quick Reference

| Destination          | Sink Type            | Best For                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Application DB       | `postgres`           | Row-level lookups, joins, application serving |
| Real-time aggregates | `postgres_aggregate` | Balances, counters, running totals via triggers|
| Analytics queries    | `clickhouse`         | Large-scale aggregations, time-series data    |
| Event processing     | `kafka`              | Downstream consumers, event-driven systems    |
| Serverless streaming | `s2_sink`            | S2.dev streams, alternative to Kafka          |
| Notifications        | `webhook`            | Lambda functions, API callbacks, alerts        |
| Data lake            | `s3_sink`            | Long-term archival, batch processing          |
| Testing              | `blackhole`          | Validate pipeline without writing data        |

### Decision Flowchart

```
What's your primary use case?
│
├─ Application serving (REST/GraphQL API)
│  └─ PostgreSQL ← row-level lookups, joins, strong consistency
│
├─ Analytics / dashboards
│  ├─ Time-series queries → ClickHouse ← columnar, fast aggregations
│  └─ Full-text search → Elasticsearch / OpenSearch
│
├─ Real-time aggregations (balances, counters)
│  └─ PostgreSQL Aggregate ← trigger-based running totals
│
├─ Event-driven downstream processing
│  ├─ Need Kafka ecosystem → Kafka
│  └─ Serverless / simpler → S2 (s2.dev)
│
├─ Notifications / webhooks
│  └─ Webhook ← HTTP POST per event
│
├─ Long-term archival
│  └─ S3 ← object storage, cheapest for bulk data
│
├─ Just testing
│  └─ Blackhole ← validates pipeline without writing
│
└─ Multiple of the above
   └─ Use multiple sinks in the same pipeline (fan-out pattern)
```

### PostgreSQL Aggregate Sink

The `postgres_aggregate` sink is uniquely suited for **real-time running aggregations** (balances, counters, totals). It uses a two-table pattern: a landing table that receives raw events, and an aggregation table maintained by a database trigger.

```yaml
sinks:
  token_balances:
    type: postgres_aggregate
    from: transfers
    schema: public
    landing_table: transfer_events
    agg_table: account_balances
    primary_key: id
    secret_name: MY_POSTGRES
    group_by:
      account:
        type: text
      token_address:
        type: text
    aggregate:
      balance:
        from: amount
        fn: sum
      transfer_count:
        from: id
        fn: count
```

**Supported aggregation functions:** `sum`, `count`, `avg`, `min`, `max`

### Multi-Sink Considerations

- Each sink reads from a `from:` field — different sinks can read from different transforms
- Sinks are independent — one failing doesn't block others
- Use different `batch_size` / `batch_flush_interval` per sink based on latency needs
- ClickHouse supports `parallelism: N` for concurrent writers (default `1`)

### Webhook Sinks Without Secrets

Webhooks can use a direct URL instead of a secret when no auth headers are needed:

```yaml
sinks:
  my_webhook:
    type: webhook
    from: my_transform
    url: https://my-lambda.us-west-2.on.aws/
```

---

## Pipeline Splitting Decisions

### One Pipeline vs. Multiple

**Use one pipeline when:**
- All data comes from the same source
- Transforms share intermediate results (e.g., a shared decode step)
- You want atomic deployment of the whole flow

**Split into multiple pipelines when:**
- Different data sources with no shared transforms
- Different lifecycle needs (one is stable, another changes frequently)
- Different resource requirements (one needs `l`, another needs `s`)
- Different chains with independent processing (templated pattern)

### Keeping Pipelines Focused

A pipeline should ideally do **one logical thing**:

| Pipeline                        | Focus                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `dex-trades`                    | Trade events → Postgres             |
| `dex-activities`                | All activity types → ClickHouse DWH |
| `token-balances`                | Token balances → Postgres           |
| `base-balance-streaming`        | Base balances → ClickHouse + webhook |

Even though trades are a subset of activities, they're separate pipelines because they serve different consumers (application DB vs data warehouse).

---

## Streaming vs Job Mode

Turbo pipelines have two execution modes:

### Streaming Mode (Default)

```yaml
name: my-streaming-pipeline
resource_size: s
# job: false  (default — omit this field)
```

- Runs continuously, processing data as it arrives
- Maintains checkpoints for exactly-once processing
- Use for real-time feeds, dashboards, APIs

### Job Mode (One-Time Batch)

```yaml
name: my-backfill-job
resource_size: l
job: true
```

- Runs to completion and stops automatically
- Auto-deletes resources ~1 hour after completion
- **Must delete before redeploying** — cannot update a job pipeline, must `goldsky turbo delete` first
- **Cannot use `restart`** — use delete + apply instead
- Use for historical backfills, one-time data migrations, snapshot exports

### When to Use Which

| Scenario                             | Mode        | Why                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time dashboard                  | Streaming   | Continuous updates needed                      |
| Backfill 6 months of history         | Job         | One-time, stops when done                      |
| Real-time + catch-up on deploy       | Streaming   | `start_at: earliest` does backfill then streams|
| Export data to S3 once               | Job         | No need for continuous processing              |
| Webhook notifications on events      | Streaming   | Needs to react as events happen                |
| Load test with historical data       | Job         | Process and inspect, then discard              |

### Job Mode with Bounded Ranges

Combine job mode with `start_at: earliest` and an `end_block` to process a specific range:

```yaml
name: historical-export
resource_size: l
job: true

sources:
  logs:
    type: dataset
    dataset_name: ethereum.raw_logs
    version: 1.0.0
    start_at: earliest
    end_block: 19000000
    filter: >-
      address = '0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7'
```

---

## Dynamic Table Architecture

Dynamic tables enable **runtime-updatable lookup data** within a pipeline. They're the Turbo answer to the "no joins in streaming SQL" limitation.

### Pattern: Dynamic Allowlist/Blocklist

```
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │  External Updates     │
                    │  (Postgres / REST)    │
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               ▼
source ──→ sql transform ──→ [dynamic_table_check()] ──→ sink
```

The SQL transform filters records against the dynamic table. The table contents can be updated externally without pipeline restart.

### Pattern: Lookup Enrichment

```
source ──→ decode ──→ filter ──→ sql (with dynamic_table_check) ──→ sink
                                        ▲
                              [token_metadata table]
                              (postgres-backed)
```

Store metadata (token symbols, decimals, protocol names) in a PostgreSQL table. Reference it in transforms for enrichment.

### Backend Decisions

| Backend     | `backend_type` | When to Use                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL  | `Postgres`     | Data managed by external systems, shared across pipeline restarts |
| In-memory   | `InMemory`     | Auto-populated from pipeline data, ephemeral, fastest lookups     |

### Sizing Considerations

- Dynamic tables add memory overhead proportional to table size
- For large lookup tables (>100K rows), use `Postgres` backend
- For small, frequently-changing lists (<10K rows), `InMemory` is faster
- Dynamic table queries are async — they add slight latency per record

# Product Spec Template

A structured 9-section template for defining software product specifications.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project from a one-liner idea
- Converting rough notes into a formal specification
- Reviewing spec completeness before implementation
- Ensuring consistent spec format across projects

## The 9 Sections

### Section Structure

Every spec.md should include these sections:

```markdown
## 🎯 [Product Name]

### 🧠 One-Line Definition

> **[Concise description: what it is, key differentiator, core value prop]**

### Top Principles
- [Guiding principle 1]
- [Guiding principle 2]
- [Guiding principle 3]

### 1. [Core Capability Area]
| Category | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| ... | ... |

### 2. [Controls / Interactions]
| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ... | ... |

### 3. [Technical / Output Format]
| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ... | ... |

### 4. [Secondary Feature Area]
| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ... | ... |

### 5. [Tertiary Feature Area]
| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ... | ... |

### 6. [Optional Feature Area]
| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| ... | ... |

### 7. UI / UX Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ... | ... |

### 8. Platform / Scope
| Platform | Priority |
|----------|----------|
| ... | ... |

### 9. Explicit Non-Goals
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| [Feature X] | ❌ |
| [Feature Y] | ❌ |
```

## Section Guidelines

### One-Line Definition
- Must be a single sentence
- Include: what it is, how it differs, core value
- Example: "A lightweight screen recorder that matches GNOME Screencast's minimal UX, adds audio capture, and supports basic post-capture annotation."

### Top Principles
- 3-5 guiding principles
- Drive prioritization decisions
- Examples: "Quickly deliverable MVP", "Cross-platform support", "Minimal UI"

### Feature Sections (1-6)
- Use tables for consistency
- Mark support: ✅ (yes), ❌ (no), Optional, Basic
- Group related features
- Section names vary by product type

### UI/UX Principles
- Reference existing UX patterns when applicable
- Define the "feel" of the product
- Include mode-based behavior if relevant

### Platform Scope
- List all target platforms
- Mark priority: Primary, Supported, Future
- Be explicit about what's NOT supported initially

### Non-Goals
- Critical section—prevents scope creep
- List features explicitly excluded
- Mark all with ❌
- Include common requests that won't be built

## Output Quality Checklist

- [ ] One-liner is truly one sentence
- [ ] Principles are actionable, not vague
- [ ] Feature tables use consistent format
- [ ] Non-goals section is substantive (5+ items)
- [ ] No ambiguous "maybe" features—decide yes/no
- [ ] Platform priorities are clear

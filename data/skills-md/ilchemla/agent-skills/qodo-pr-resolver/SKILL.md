# Qodo PR Resolver

Efficiently process PR review comments from Qodo PR Agent through a structured 3-phase workflow: **Analyze → Confirm → Execute**.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Severity-based prioritization** (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
- 🧪 **Automatic test integration** and CI check fixing
- 📦 **Smart commit strategy** (functional vs cosmetic separation)
- 💬 **Standardized reply templates**
- ✅ **Automatic thread resolution** via GitHub API
- 🔍 **Multi-issue comment detection** and verification
- 🔄 **Fresh data verification** for completion

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Responding to Qodo PR Agent review comments on GitHub
- Addressing automated code review feedback
- Managing multiple review threads efficiently
- Need to validate comment relevance before acting
- Want structured approach to handling PR feedback with severity prioritization

## Prerequisites

**GitHub CLI Required:**

```bash
# Check installation
gh --version

# Authenticate if needed
gh auth login
```

## Critical Constraints

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
- Only **unresolved comments** are processed (resolved comments are skipped)
- **Phase 2 (Confirm) MUST run in parent process** - never use AskUserQuestion in sub-agents
- **CRITICAL/HIGH fixes require passing tests** - cannot skip
- **All sub-issues** in multi-issue comments must be addressed
- **Fresh verification** confirms zero unresolved items before completion

## 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: ANALYZE (Parallel Sub-agents)

**Step 1: Fetch Data**
- Get current PR number and details
- Fetch **both types** of Qodo comments:
  - **General comments**: Summary comment with all issues (via `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr}/comments`)
  - **Inline comments**: Comments on specific lines (via `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments`)
- Parse HTML to extract clean issue descriptions from both formats
- Extract **Agent Prompt** sections (ready-to-use fix instructions)
- Deduplicate issues that appear in both comment types
- Fetch failing CI checks (lint, tests, format)

**Step 2: Deduplicate Issues**
- Same issue may appear in both general and inline comments
- Deduplicate by: `file:line:title` or `description_similarity`
- Prefer inline comment if duplicate (has better metadata)
- Track both comment IDs for thread resolution

**Step 3: Parallel Analysis**
- Launch Task agent (subagent_type="general-purpose") for EACH unique issue/check
- Each agent analyzes:
  - **Extract Agent Prompt**: Parse `<details><summary>Agent Prompt</summary>` or `<summary>Agent prompt</summary>` section from HTML
  - **Severity**: Detect from Qodo badges (🐞 ⛨ 📘) + keywords (see [Severity Guide](references/severity-guide.md))
  - **Multi-issue detection**: For general comments, each `<details>` block is separate issue
  - **Validity**: valid/invalid/partial based on Evidence section
  - **Context**: Read file:line from metadata (inline) or GitHub links (general), understand purpose
  - **Action**: fix/reply/defer/ignore
  - **Fix proposal**: Use Agent Prompt + Fix Focus Areas as primary guidance

**Step 4: Sort Results**
- Sort by severity: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
- Group related issues from same file
- Prepare structured summary with both general and inline comment IDs

### Phase 2: CONFIRM (Parent Process Only)

**Present Analysis:**

Display comments grouped by severity:

```
🔴 CRITICAL Issues (2):
  Comment #1 (auth.py:156) [MULTI-ISSUE: 2 items]
  - SQL injection AND missing validation
  - Action: fix (Recommended)

🟡 HIGH Issues (1):
  Comment #2 (service.py:42)
  - Null pointer exception
  - Action: fix (Recommended)

🟢 MEDIUM Issues (1):
  Comment #3 (utils.py:18)
  - Performance optimization
  - Action: defer (Recommended)

⚪ LOW Issues (2):
  Comments #4-5 - Variable naming, docstrings
  - Action: fix (batch together)

CI Checks (2 failing):
  - Lint: ESLint errors
  - Tests: 2 failing tests
```

**Get Confirmation:**
- Use AskUserQuestion for each severity group
- Options: Apply fix, Reply to reviewer, Defer to issue, Ignore, Custom
- CRITICAL/HIGH default to "Apply fix (Recommended)"
- Allow multi-select for similar comments

### Phase 3: EXECUTE

**Step 1: Detect Configuration**
- Auto-detect test/lint/format commands from project config
- See [Test Integration Guide](references/test-integration.md)

**Step 2: Apply Fixes (By Severity)**
- Process CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
- For each fix:
  - Apply code changes
  - Verify all sub-issues addressed (for multi-issue comments)
  - Commit with appropriate strategy:
    - **CRITICAL/HIGH**: Individual commits
    - **MEDIUM/LOW**: Batch into single commit
- Use Conventional Commits format
- See [Commit Strategy Guide](references/commit-strategy.md)

**Step 3: Fix CI Checks**
- Run lint --fix, formatters
- Commit CI fixes separately

**Step 4: Run Tests**
- Execute detected test command
- **MUST pass** for CRITICAL/HIGH fixes
- Handle failures: retry/fix/skip/abort
- See [Test Integration Guide](references/test-integration.md)

**Step 5: Push Changes**
- Push all commits at once
- Verify push succeeded

**Step 6: Reply to Reviewers**
- Reply to **all comment locations** where issue appears:
  - If issue is in general comment: Reply to that comment
  - If issue is in inline comment: Reply to that inline thread
  - If issue appears in both: Reply to both locations with same message
- Use standard templates for each comment:
  - **Fixed**: "Fixed in [hash]: description"
  - **Won't Fix**: "Won't fix: reason"
  - **By Design**: "By design: explanation"
  - **Deferred**: "Deferred to #issue: will address later"
  - **Acknowledged**: "Acknowledged: note"
- See [Reply Templates](references/reply-templates.md)

**Step 7: Resolve Threads**
- Mark each addressed thread as resolved via GitHub GraphQL API
- For issues in both locations, resolve both threads
- Skip if user selected "Ignore"

**Step 8: Fresh Verification**
- Re-fetch PR data
- Confirm zero unresolved comments
- Verify all CI checks passing
- Provide completion summary

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Qodo Indicators | Keywords | Priority | Commit |
|----------|-----------------|----------|----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | ⛨ Security, 🐞 Bug (security) | security, vulnerability, injection, XSS, SQL | Must fix first | Individual |
| **HIGH** | 🐞 Bug, ⛯ Reliability | bug, error, crash, fail, memory leak | Should fix | Individual |
| **MEDIUM** | 📘 Rule violation, ✓ Correctness | performance, refactor, code smell, rule violation | Recommended | Batch |
| **LOW** | 📎 Requirement gaps (minor) | style, nit, formatting, typo | Optional | Batch |

**Qodo-Specific Detection:**
- Parse HTML for emoji badges: `🐞 Bug`, `📘 Rule violation`, `⛨ Security`
- Extract severity from badge combinations
- Security badge (⛨) → Always CRITICAL
- Bug badge (🐞) → HIGH (or CRITICAL if security-related)

**Processing order**: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW

See [Severity Guide](references/severity-guide.md) for detailed classification rules.

## Qodo-Specific Handling

**Two Comment Types:**

Qodo posts comments in **two locations**:

1. **General Comment** (Summary) - Contains all issues in one comment on the PR conversation
2. **Inline Comments** - Individual comments on specific code lines

**IMPORTANT**: You must fetch **both** to get all issues. General comment often contains issues not in inline comments.

**Fetch General Comments:**
```bash
# General PR comments (summary with all issues)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments | jq '[.[] |
  select(.user.login == "qodo-code-review[bot]" or .user.login == "qodo-merge[bot]")
]'
```

**Fetch Inline Comments:**
```bash
# Inline code review comments (specific lines)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments | jq '[.[] |
  select(.user.login == "qodo-code-review[bot]" or .user.login == "qodo-merge[bot]") |
  select(.in_reply_to_id == null)
]'
```

**Parse General Comments:**
- General comment contains multiple issues in nested `<details>` blocks
- Structure: `<details><summary>1. Title <code>📘 Rule violation</code></summary>` (collapsed sections)
- Each issue has: Description, Code snippet, Evidence, Agent Prompt
- Extract file/line from GitHub links: `[app/file.py[R363-380]](https://github.com/...)`
- Parse all `<details>` sections to get complete issue list

**Parse Inline Comments:**
- Simpler structure with single issue per comment
- Metadata available: `.path`, `.line`, `.body`
- May contain same issues as general comment (deduplicate by file+line+title)

**HTML Parsing:**
- Extract clean text from HTML using regex or HTML parser
- Parse `<details><summary>Agent Prompt</summary>` or `<summary>Agent prompt</summary>` for fix instructions
- Extract numbered items: `1. Title 📘 Rule violation ✓ Correctness`
- Look for **Fix Focus Areas** section for file:line locations
- For general comments: Parse multiple `<details>` blocks to extract all issues

**Severity Detection:**
- ⛨ Security badge → CRITICAL
- 🐞 Bug + Security context → CRITICAL
- 🐞 Bug → HIGH
- 📘 Rule violation → MEDIUM
- 📎 Requirement gaps → LOW (or MEDIUM depending on context)

**Agent Prompt Usage:**
- Qodo provides ready-to-use fix prompts in `<details><summary>Agent Prompt</summary>`
- Extract these and use as primary fix guidance
- Agent Prompt contains: Issue description, Issue Context, Fix Focus Areas

**Response Format:**
- Match user's response pattern:
  - `✅ **FIXED** in commit [hash]` - Description
  - `❌ **NOT APPLICABLE**` - Reasoning
  - `📋 **DEFERRED** to #issue` - Will address later

## Best Practices

### Analysis Phase
- **Severity first**: Classify before recommending action
- **Detect multi-issue**: Look for "AND", "also", "additionally"
- **Parallel execution**: Launch all agents at once
- **Include CI checks**: Analyze failing checks alongside comments

### Confirmation Phase
- **Present by severity**: Show CRITICAL first, LOW last
- **Smart defaults**: CRITICAL/HIGH default to "Apply fix"
- **Group similar**: Batch related MEDIUM/LOW comments

### Execution Phase
- **Process by severity**: Fix CRITICAL first, LOW last
- **Verify multi-issue**: Confirm ALL sub-issues addressed
- **Test before push**: NEVER push failing tests
- **Use templates**: Consistent professional replies
- **Resolve threads**: Automate via API
- **Fresh verification**: Always re-fetch to confirm completion

## Important Notes

- This skill is designed specifically for Qodo PR Agent comments
- Can be adapted for other automated review tools by modifying bot username filter
- Always verify changes before pushing to ensure correctness
- Maintain professional tone in all reviewer interactions (no emojis in replies)
- The analyze phase is crucial - thorough exploration prevents incorrect fixes
- Test integration ensures changes don't break existing functionality
- Fresh verification provides confidence that all work is complete

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before:**
- `/cleanup` - Clean up code before review

**After:**
- `/create-ticket` - Create tickets for deferred items
- `/commit` - Additional commits if needed
- Verify: `gh pr checks` - All CI passing

# Portfolio Status Skill

Procedural knowledge for generating comprehensive portfolio health reports across all initiatives.

## When to Use

- Running `/status-all` command
- Answering "where are we across everything?"
- Weekly/daily status reviews
- Identifying portfolio-wide blockers and gaps
- Prioritizing what to work on next

## Data Sources

Scan initiative folders organized by status:

```
pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/
├── active/*/               # Active initiatives (mapped 1:1 to Notion Projects DB) - PRIMARY scan target
│   ├── _meta.json          # Phase, status, priority, notion_project_id
│   ├── research.md         # User research
│   ├── prd.md              # Product requirements
│   ├── design-brief.md     # Design specifications
│   ├── engineering-spec.md # Technical spec
│   ├── prototype-notes.md  # Prototype documentation
│   ├── gtm-brief.md        # Go-to-market plan
│   └── jury-evaluations/   # Validation results
├── done/*/                 # Completed initiatives (Notion Phase = Done) - include in portfolio counts
├── archived/*/             # Local-only, not in Notion - EXCLUDE from portfolio status
└── _template/              # Template - EXCLUDE
```

**IMPORTANT:** Portfolio status should primarily scan `active/` and `done/`. Exclude `archived/` and `_template/`.

Also load:

- `pm-workspace-docs/roadmap/roadmap.json` - Priority and phase data
- `pm-workspace-docs/signals/_index.json` - Linked signals
- `pm-workspace-docs/status/history.json` - Previous snapshots (if exists)
- `pm-workspace-docs/status/dev-status-*.json` - Latest dev status (if exists)
- `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/active/*/metrics-contract.json` - Measurement readiness coverage

## MCP Tools Available (Optional Enhancement)

**Server:** `composio-config` (Composio)

Use MCP tools to enrich portfolio status with live data:

| Source      | Tools                                                                           | Enhancement                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear**  | `LINEAR_LIST_LINEAR_PROJECTS`, `LINEAR_SEARCH_ISSUES`                           | Pull live issue counts, cycle progress                     |
| **PostHog** | `POSTHOG_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_INSIGHTS`, `POSTHOG_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_INSIGHT_DETAILS` | Pull success metric values for initiatives with dashboards |
| **Notion**  | `NOTION_QUERY_DATABASE`                                                         | Cross-reference with Notion Projects DB                    |
| **Slack**   | `SLACK_SEARCH_MESSAGES`                                                         | Check for recent activity mentions                         |

**When to use:**

- `/status-all --live` → Query Linear/PostHog for real-time data
- Health scoring → Use PostHog metrics to validate initiative health
- Blockers → Check Linear for blocked issues

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Discover All Initiatives

List all directories in `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/active/` and `pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/done/` excluding:

- `_template/` - Template folder
- `archived/` - Local-only initiatives not in Notion Projects DB
- Any folder starting with `.` or `_`

**Note:** Active initiatives are now 1:1 mapped with Notion Projects. Each `_meta.json` contains a `notion_project_id` field.

### Step 2: Collect Initiative Data

For each initiative, extract from `_meta.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "initiative-name",
  "phase": "discovery | define | build | validate | launch",
  "status": "on_track | at_risk | blocked | paused",
  "priority": "P0 | P1 | P2 | P3",
  "owner": "name",
  "personas": [],
  "pillar": "pillar-name",
  "updated_at": "ISO8601",
  "created_at": "ISO8601",
  "blockers": [],
  "jury_results": { "pass_rate": 0.0 }
}
```

If `_meta.json` is missing, mark as `incomplete_metadata`.

### Step 3: Check Artifact Completeness

For each initiative, check file existence:

| Artifact         | File                    | Status                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Research         | `research.md`           | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| PRD              | `prd.md`                | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| Design Brief     | `design-brief.md`       | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| Engineering Spec | `engineering-spec.md`   | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| Prototype        | `prototype-notes.md`    | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| GTM Brief        | `gtm-brief.md`          | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| Jury Evaluation  | `jury-evaluations/*.md` | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| METRICS          | `METRICS.md`            | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| Metrics Contract | `metrics-contract.json` | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |
| Decisions        | `decisions.md`          | ✅ exists / ❌ missing |

**Artifact Completeness %** = (artifacts present / total expected for phase) \* 100

Expected artifacts by phase:

- **Discovery**: Research
- **Define**: Research, PRD, Design Brief, Decisions
- **Build**: Research, PRD, Design Brief, Engineering Spec, Prototype Notes, METRICS, Metrics Contract, Decisions
- **Validate**: All above + Jury Evaluation
- **Launch**: All artifacts including GTM Brief

### Step 4: Calculate Staleness

| Days in Phase | Status        |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0-7           | 🟢 Fresh      |
| 8-14          | 🟡 Monitor    |
| 15-21         | 🟠 Stale      |
| 22+           | 🔴 Very Stale |

Calculate `days_in_phase` from `_meta.json.updated_at` or `phase_history`.

### Step 5: Assess Graduation Readiness

For each initiative, check if ready to advance:

#### Discovery → Define

- [x] `research.md` exists with content
- [x] User problems documented
- [x] Primary JTBD articulated
- [x] Personas identified in `_meta.json`
- [x] Owner assigned in `_meta.json`

#### Define → Build

- [x] `prd.md` exists
- [x] `design-brief.md` exists
- [x] Outcome chain defined
- [x] E2E experience addressed (all 5 steps)
- [x] Feedback method defined (`_meta.json.feedback_method` set)
- [x] `decisions.md` exists

#### Build → Validate

- [x] `prototype-notes.md` exists
- [x] States documented (Loading, Error, Empty, Success)
- [x] Chromatic URL or prototype location
- [x] Discovery and activation flows prototyped
- [x] `METRICS.md` exists with baselines or plan
- [x] `metrics-contract.json` exists with `validation.status`

#### Validate → Launch

- [x] Jury pass rate ≥70%
- [x] All 5 experience steps validated
- [x] Stakeholder approval
- [x] No P0 blockers
- [x] `gtm-brief.md` exists with customer story and launch materials
- [x] Success metric baselines established
- [x] Measurement readiness status tracked (`metrics-contract.json`)
- [x] Feedback instrument planned or live

**Ready to Advance** = All criteria met for current phase transition

### Step 6: Calculate Portfolio Health Score

| Metric                 | Weight | Score Calculation                       |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| No blocked initiatives | 25     | 25 if 0, 15 if 1, 0 if 2+               |
| Artifact completeness  | 25     | (avg completeness %) \* 0.25            |
| No stale initiatives   | 20     | 20 if 0, 10 if 1-2, 0 if 3+             |
| Phase distribution     | 15     | See balance check below                 |
| Jury pass rates        | 15     | (avg pass rate where available) \* 0.15 |

**Phase Distribution Balance:**

- Ideal: 10-20% discovery, 20-30% define, 30-40% build, 10-20% validate
- Score 15 if within ranges, 8 if slightly off, 0 if severely imbalanced

**Total Health Score = Sum of all metric scores (0-100)**

### Step 7: Generate Action Queue

Prioritize actions using this algorithm:

```
Score = (Priority_Weight * 10) + (Blocking_Impact * 5) + (Quick_Win * 3) + (Graduation_Ready * 2)

Priority_Weight:
- P0 = 4
- P1 = 3
- P2 = 2
- P3 = 1

Blocking_Impact:
- Blocks other initiatives = 2
- Blocks same initiative = 1
- No blocking = 0

Quick_Win:
- Can complete in <1 hour = 2
- Can complete in <1 day = 1
- Longer = 0

Graduation_Ready:
- Ready to advance with this action = 2
- Partially ready = 1
- Not ready = 0
```

Sort actions by score descending, limit to top 10.

### Step 8: Include Dev Activity Data

If `dev_activity` exists in `_meta.json`, include in analysis:

```json
{
  "dev_activity": {
    "last_synced": "2026-01-23T18:00:00Z",
    "linear_issues_total": 57,
    "linear_issues_completed": 23,
    "linear_issues_in_progress": 10,
    "github_prs_merged_30d": 15
  }
}
```

**Dev Progress Calculation:**

- If `linear_issues_total` > 0: `completed / total * 100`
- Show as percentage in artifact matrix

**Activity Flags:**

- **High Activity**: >5 issues in progress OR >3 PRs in last 7 days
- **Stale Code**: >14 days since last PR with >0 issues in progress
- **Docs Drift**: High activity but docs >14 days stale

**Add to Health Score (optional boost):**

- Active development with current docs: +5 points
- High activity with stale docs: -5 points (alert)

### Step 9: Compare to History (Trends)

If `pm-workspace-docs/status/history.json` exists, compare:

- Health score change (↑ improved, ↓ declined, → stable)
- Phase advances since last check
- New blockers since last check
- Initiatives added/removed

## Saving Results

After generating report:

1. Save markdown to `pm-workspace-docs/status/status-all-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Save JSON to `pm-workspace-docs/status/status-all-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
3. Update `pm-workspace-docs/status/history.json` with snapshot

History JSON format:

```json
{
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "date": "2026-01-23",
      "health_score": 78,
      "total_initiatives": 19,
      "by_phase": {...},
      "by_status": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Edge Cases

### No Initiatives Found

```
⚠️ No initiatives found in pm-workspace-docs/initiatives/active/

Create your first initiative with:
/new-initiative [name]
```

### All Initiatives Missing Metadata

```
⚠️ Found X initiatives but none have _meta.json files.

Run `/maintain fix` to generate metadata for all initiatives.
```

### First Run (No History)

```
ℹ️ First portfolio status run - no historical data for comparison.

Future runs will show trends.
```

## Integration with Other Commands

After generating status, suggest relevant follow-ups:

- Stale initiative → `/status [name]` for details
- Missing artifacts → `/pm [name]` or `/proto [name]`
- Failed jury → `/iterate [name]`
- Ready for launch → `/share`
- Phase imbalance → `/roadmap` for prioritization
- Missing dev data → `/sync-dev` to refresh Linear/GitHub data
- Docs drift alert → Update stale docs for active initiatives
- No Linear mapping → `/sync-linear --map` to suggest mappings

## Dev Pipeline Integration

### Running with Fresh Data

For most accurate view, run sync first:

```
/sync-dev          # Refresh Linear + GitHub data
/status-all        # Generate status with fresh dev activity
```

### Alert Types

| Alert           | Condition                              | Recommended Action         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `docs_drift`    | Dev activity high, docs >14 days stale | Update research/PRD        |
| `no_linear`     | Missing `linear_project_id`            | Run `/sync-linear --map`   |
| `stale_code`    | Issues in progress, no PRs in 14 days  | Check blocked work         |
| `high_activity` | >5 issues active                       | May need phase advancement |

### Dev Activity in Health Score

Base health score calculation remains unchanged. Dev activity provides:

- **Context**: Understand if an initiative is active even if docs are stale
- **Alerts**: Surface initiatives where code and docs are out of sync
- **Velocity**: Track shipping rate per initiative

# Code Quality — Standards & Review

> **CRITICAL SKILL** — Be **concise, direct, and solution-focused**.

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **SRP** | Single Responsibility — each function/class does ONE thing |
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself — extract duplicates, reuse |
| **KISS** | Keep It Simple — simplest solution that works |
| **YAGNI** | You Aren't Gonna Need It — don't build unused features |
| **Boy Scout** | Leave code cleaner than you found it |

---

## Naming Rules

| Element | Convention |
|---------|------------|
| **Variables** | Reveal intent: `userCount` not `n` |
| **Functions** | Verb + noun: `getUserById()` not `user()` |
| **Booleans** | Question form: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit` |
| **Constants** | SCREAMING_SNAKE: `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` |

> **Rule:** If you need a comment to explain a name, rename it.

---

## Function Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Small** | Max 20 lines, ideally 5-10 |
| **One Thing** | Does one thing, does it well |
| **One Level** | One level of abstraction per function |
| **Few Args** | Max 3 arguments, prefer 0-2 |
| **No Side Effects** | Don't mutate inputs unexpectedly |

---

## Code Structure

| Pattern | Apply |
|---------|-------|
| **Guard Clauses** | Early returns for edge cases |
| **Flat > Nested** | Avoid deep nesting (max 2 levels) |
| **Composition** | Small functions composed together |
| **Colocation** | Keep related code close |

---

## Code Review Checklist

### Correctness
- [ ] Code does what it's supposed to do
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] No obvious bugs

### Security
- [ ] Input validated and sanitized
- [ ] No SQL/NoSQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] No XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or sensitive credentials
- [ ] **AI-Specific:** Protection against Prompt Injection (if applicable)
- [ ] **AI-Specific:** Outputs are sanitized before being used in critical sinks

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] No unnecessary loops
- [ ] Appropriate caching
- [ ] Bundle size impact considered

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new code
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Tests readable and maintainable

### Documentation
- [ ] Complex logic commented
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] README updated if needed

---

## AI & LLM Review Patterns (2025)

### Logic & Hallucinations
- [ ] **Chain of Thought:** Does the logic follow a verifiable path?
- [ ] **Edge Cases:** Did the AI account for empty states, timeouts, and partial failures?
- [ ] **External State:** Is the code making safe assumptions about file systems or networks?

### Prompt Engineering Review
```markdown
// ❌ Vague prompt in code
const response = await ai.generate(userInput);

// ✅ Structured & Safe prompt
const response = await ai.generate({
  system: "You are a specialized parser...",
  input: sanitize(userInput),
  schema: ResponseSchema
});
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Pattern | ✅ Fix |
|-----------|-------|
| Comment every line | Delete obvious comments |
| Helper for one-liner | Inline the code |
| Factory for 2 objects | Direct instantiation |
| utils.ts with 1 function | Put code where used |
| "First we import..." | Just write code |
| Deep nesting | Guard clauses |
| Magic numbers | Named constants |
| God functions | Split by responsibility |
| `any` type | Proper types |
| Long functions (100+ lines) | Small, focused functions |

---

## Review Comments Guide

```
// Blocking issues use 🔴
🔴 BLOCKING: SQL injection vulnerability here

// Important suggestions use 🟡
🟡 SUGGESTION: Consider using useMemo for performance

// Minor nits use 🟢
🟢 NIT: Prefer const over let for immutable variable

// Questions use ❓
❓ QUESTION: What happens if user is null here?
```

## AI Coding Style

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User asks for feature | Write it directly |
| User reports bug | Fix it, don't explain |
| No clear requirement | Ask, don't assume |

---

## 🔴 Before Editing ANY File (THINK FIRST!)

| Question | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **What imports this file?** | They might break |
| **What does this file import?** | Interface changes |
| **What tests cover this?** | Tests might fail |
| **Is this a shared component?** | Multiple places affected |

> 🔴 **Rule:** Edit the file + all dependent files in the SAME task.
> 🔴 **Never leave broken imports or missing updates.**

---

## 🔴 Self-Check Before Completing (MANDATORY)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| ✅ **Goal met?** | Did I do exactly what user asked? |
| ✅ **Files edited?** | Did I modify all necessary files? |
| ✅ **Code works?** | Did I test/verify the change? |
| ✅ **No errors?** | Lint and TypeScript pass? |
| ✅ **Nothing forgotten?** | Any edge cases missed? |

> 🔴 **Rule:** If ANY check fails, fix it before completing.

---

## Summary

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write code directly | Write tutorials |
| Let code self-document | Add obvious comments |
| Fix bugs immediately | Explain the fix first |
| Inline small things | Create unnecessary files |
| Name things clearly | Use abbreviations |
| Keep functions small | Write 100+ line functions |

> **Remember: The user wants working code, not a programming lesson.**
